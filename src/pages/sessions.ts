To this day wanted by the army, they survive as mercenaries. If you have a problem and no one else can solve it, and you can find them, then maybe you can hire The A-squad.\n\n__**The crime**__\n\n 2 months prior the group was ordered out on what was supposed to be a routine guard mission in the town Kensington. Upon arriving there nothing was as it should have been, what should have been a triving little town laid destitude. The dead body of the villagers laid spread out accross the town, clearly dead by sword and magic.\n\nThe group promptly returned to the capital to report their findings, however upon arriving they were unexpectedly arrested and charged with the attack on, and mass murder of the town of Kensington. After a short farce of a trial the group was sentenced to death for a crime they did not commit.' },
  { 'id': 'session1', 'label': 'Session 1', 'text': '__**Session 1**__:\n\n The A-Squad traveled to Stonewood, as they had been contacted by a currier with a mysterious message. Someone that knew information that could help them clear their names would contact them in Stonewood.\n\nUpon arriving in Stonewood the A-Squad were confronted with 4 Bandits stabbing and stealing a satchel of an old man. The group defeated the bandits, but their leader arrived and used a smoke bomb to escape with the satchel and the 2 bandits still alive.\n\nThe dagger that stabbed the old man turned out to be poisoned and the A-squad made their way into the forest to seak out an old woman named Old Olga, reknown for her high level alchemy. There they recieved a potions that required the blood of a relative to work. The group returned to Stonewood and administered the medicine with the help of the old mans daughter. The man immediately started to breath calmer and the corruption around the wound started to shrink.\n\nAs the A-squad celebrated this in the tavern they learn of a spider infested cave. The locals where afraid that children would visit the cave and be poisioned by the spiders. The A-squad decided to clear out the cave. In the depths of the cave the group came upon a sarchophagus with an inscription to Othar Brightshield, that fell in the war. A smaller runestone held an inscription about the group the burried him wanting to return after the war to carry his heirloom to his familiy. Upon opening the sarchophagus the group found a beautiful warhammer with the inscription "Bakrus", upon taking the hammer a sound clung through the minds of the group "Return me to my home"' },
  { 'id': 'session2', 'label': 'Session 2', 'text': '__**Session 2**__:\n\n After a night of drinking in the tavern The A-Squad was awakened by someone entering their room in the morning. A slightly odd Halfling with an amazing southern accent, named Filibert Silentfoot.\n\nAfter a short introduction it became clear that Silentfoot was the one that had asked them to Stonewood. Siltenfoot works in an organization that deals in information, through their dealing they had come in touch with information that the A-Squad was innocent and that Stonewood was the next target. Whoever is behind framing the A-Squad seems to have been working in the shadows to destabilize Kensington before attacking the killing the inhabitants.\n\nBeing afraid that Stonewood would be destabilize before an coming attack the A-Squad agreed investigate any potential attempts of doing this. While this happened Silentfoot would work from the shadows attempting to find more information. To allow for communication between the two groups Silentfoot gave the A-Squad a communication stone.\n\nAfter talking with the Old Man that was stabbed the previous day, it became clear that Stonewood is currently in the middle of a family feude between the Wheatfallows and the Miller families, regarding a inherritance of a prime location marked house. Because of this the Wheatfallows believe the Millers to be behind the stabbing.\n\nThe A-Squad sought out the Mill house, where they were promptly attacked by a group of infiltrators, one of which was an illusionist. The infiltrators were defeated but the illusionist got away. After discovering that the attackers where Hobgoblins desguised as humans the Miller patriarch Anton confronted the players. He believes that he was the intended target of the attack and that this attack was a part of a bigger conspiracy. After he rushed off to talk with the leader of the town guard the A-Squad decided to search his house for any helpful information. The only thing they discovered that a person named Gordon Wheatfallow has been seen lurking around the Mill last night.\n\nAfter a some investigation around Stonewood the A-squad discovered that Gordon Wheatfallow is the town drunk and that he hasn\'t been seen at his local drinking hole for a while. A quick search of his bed chamber revealed some Shadowspark a herb that produces an unusually long lasting flame when lit.\n\nThe A-squad called up Silentfoot and shared their findings with him. Silentfoot believes that the Hobgoblins are likely behind the conspiracy, but he is unsure of their motivation. He did however reveal that he had found the location of the bandit group behind the stabbing, furthermore he had discovered that the attack was indeed hired by someone else.\n\nThe A-Squad promptly departed into the forest to find the Bandit Camp. Silentfoot remained in the town promising to contact the squad by the communication stone if there was an emergency.\n\nUpon traveling into the forest the group encountered a lively satyr native to the area. After a light exchange of music, alcohol and elvish conversation the satyr promised to show the A-quad to the bandit camp by an extremelly quick path, if they in return would attempt to return his Camembert that was stolen by the bandits.\n\nJust as the sun was setting the A-Squad came upon a bandit camp surrounded by wooden pillars. The sound of lively discussion from around the campfires filled the forest opening as the A-Squad hunched down far enough away to not be seen to plan their next move.'},
  { 'id': 'session3', 'label': 'Session 3', 'text': '__**Session 3**__:\n\n While planning the A-Squad noticed a scouting group rotating the area, promptly dispatching with the group. The A-Squad stole the groups identity and infiltrated the camp. After gathering information for a while the group was able to figure out that the Bandits were celebrating that they had been hired by a blong person named Anton to assassinate someone named John Parsons. After having found the Satyr\'s Camembert the group departed.\n\nOn their way back to Stonewood the A Squad returned the Camembert to the Satyr before getting into combat with 3 Brown Bears. Upon returning to Stonewood the group approached the leader of the guard to report what they had heard. The leader of the guard turned out to be John Parsons. John Parsons was slightly suspicious of the group, saying that he doubth that Anton Miller would do this. However if someone were to assassinate him it would make sense that they would do it tomorrow when a meeting between him, Anton Miller and Henry Wheatfallow was planned just outside town.\n\nJohn Parsons allowed the group to return to the tavern for a rest, but said to come meet him again tomorrow morning.' }
